I'm currently diving into **[Swift](https://www.swift.org/)** and working with an amazing team to build an iOS [app](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thebukuapp/) designed specifically for college students - super excited about this project!

My goal is to continually level up my skills and explore new technologies and ideas.

## 🎶 Outside Tech...

When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me:

🎤 **Singing** - Music is my creative escape!  
🎵 Check out some of my favorite covers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonquil_musique/)

🍕 **Fooood** - From street snacks to fine dining, I love discovering new cuisines and cozy cafés.  
☕ NYC foodies, let’s connect!

✈️ **Travel** - Nothing beats the thrill of experiencing new cultures, places, and perspectives.
